- 📫 You are wellcome to send a message

- I have studied a lot of University level chemistry, we need more programming skill.
- I am creating cool small objects that preform basic actions, tools that i might want in the future.
- I am not a professional and i am avoiding headerfiles as much as possoible for small projects.
- I avoid headerfiles because sometimes it just bricks everything and i dont know why, unnecessary trouble right now.  
- My dream is to create a turn based rpg game that has cooperative play and unique battle mechanics.
